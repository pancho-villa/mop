Media Organizer by Python is a utility to clean up and organize otherwise messy directories full of music, videos, docs, whatever.

Requirements
===
Python 3

It was written solely in Py3k so if you want Python 2, you'll have to run 3to2.py or port it over. Pull requests gladly accepted, so long as you create  compatibility shims in the code base so there aren't duplicates of everything.
